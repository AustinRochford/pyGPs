- rename ".train()" to ".optimize()"

- rename "Graph-stuff" to "graphExtension"

- rename kernelOnGraph to "nodeKernels" and graphKernel to "graphKernels"

- redundancy removed for model.setData(x,y)

- rewrite "mean.proceed()" to "getMean()" and "getDerMatrix()"

- rewrite "cov.proceed()" to "getCovMatrix()" and "getDerMatrix()"

- rename cov.LIN to cov.Linear (to be consistent with mean.Linear)

- rename module "valid" to "validation"

- add graph dataset Mutag in python file. (.npz and .mat)

- add graphUtil.nomalizeKernel()

- fix number of iteration problem in graphKernels "PropagationKernel"

- add framework of unit testing
