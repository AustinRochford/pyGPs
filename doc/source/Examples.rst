Demos
=========================
There are several demos for Gaussian process tasks in the package.
We recomand you to have a look at *Basic GP Regression* before reading other demos, 
which will not only introduce the regression model, but provides a general insight of the package.
You will also find the implementation of demos in the source_ folder under *pyGP_OO/Demo*.
